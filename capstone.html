									<h2>Rough concepts</h2>
									<p>From my initial user research, I created a list of six factors to consider when developing my initial concepts; physical space, collaboration, hands-on activity, user authority and investment, a simple digital interface, and a compliment of fifth grade learning objectives. Following these factors and system requirements drawn from them, I created initial concepts for both the physical planter and the app- going for quantity and variety in designs.</p>

								<h2>ASKING MY USERS</h2>
								<p>An initial usability assessment was conducted with teachers and experts, utilizing both demo + reaction  and expert reviews to collect feedback on the initial concepts I had created. From this feedback I was able to develop a list of 20+ system requirements that would guide the design of a single, testable prototype. </p>

								<h2>CREATING A PROTOTYPE</h2>
								<p>From my user feedback, I refined the designs of both the planter and web-app. Getting to a final testable planter prototype took three iterations (and a lot of carboard). The web app was created first by developing a user task-flow, and then creating a fully functional web-based prototype using the Adobe Create Suite, Sketch, and Proto.IO. These finalized protoypes were then put to the test in a stage-based testing session with late elementary school students. </p>

                                <h3> LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE </h3>

                                <h3> UNCOVERING SOME UNEXPECTED GEMS </h3>
								<p> Seeds posed the risk of being boring and "science you cannot seeds." However, seeds are a cheaper alternative to starter plants and the students seemed more excited by the prospect of growing their own plants from seeds. Another unexpected hit were the plastic syringes - using these was an engaging (and afforadable) way to learn about precise measurements. </p>

                                <h3> WHERE I MISSED <br> THE MARK </h3>
								<p> The testing session brought a hard realization - it was time to let go of a single, one-planter-fits-all-classrooms design. Both types of timers used in my protype were expensive and nearly impossible for students to navigate alone. Further, a broken lightbulb (both dangerous and not fun) highlighted the need for a more child-proof design. </p>

									<h2>WHERE I LANDED</h2>
									<h3>A system for teachers and students</h3>
									<p>Creating a system that was accessible to all elementary school classrooms was a priority of mine. My interviews with Dana Kercheval and the iterations of a physical prototype revealed an in-class planter could be achieved in a number of ways. To accomodate for the range in resources, funding, and space in elementary school classrooms, I developed a "build your own planter" guide,allowing teachers to personalize planters to their own classrooms. What is readily accessible to most classrooms is computers. I laid out a web-app that adresses the needs of both teachers and students, allowing classrooms to get the most out of the STEMS and Leaves system based on their individual needs.  </p>
