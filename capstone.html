									<h2>Rough concepts</h2>
									<p>From my initial user research, I created a list of six factors to consider when developing my initial concepts; physical space, collaboration, hands-on activity, user authority and investment, a simple digital interface, and a compliment of fifth grade learning objectives. Following these factors and system requirements drawn from them, I created initial concepts for both the physical planter and the app- going for quantity and variety in designs.</p>

								<h2>ASKING MY USERS</h2>
								<p>An initial usability assessment was conducted with teachers and experts, utilizing both demo + reaction  and expert reviews to collect feedback on the initial concepts I had created. From this feedback I was able to develop a list of 20+ system requirements that would guide the design of a single, testable prototype. </p>

							<h2>CREATING A PROTOTYPE</h2>
    
							<p>From my user feedback, I refined the designs of both the planter and web-app. Getting to a final testable planter prototype took three iterations (and a lot of carboard). The web app was created first by developing a user task-flow, and then creating a fully functional web-based prototype using the Adobe Create Suite, Sketch, and Proto.IO. These finalized protoypes were then put to the test in a stage-based testing session with late elementary school students. </p>

However, seeds are a cheaper alternative to starter plants and the students seemed more excited by the prospect of growing their own plants from seeds. Another unexpected hit were the plastic syringes - using these was an engaging (and afforadable) way to learn about precise measurements. </p>
