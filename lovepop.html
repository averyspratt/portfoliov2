                        <p >If you visit LovePops website, the first thing you'll see is their slogan: "Unexpected. Every time." It's true, the magic of a LovePop is in the surprise of opening one. Unfortunately, traditional greeting card displays don't do these laser-cut pop-up cards any favors. Partnered with former IDEO designer, Ryan Habbyshaw, I sought to answer the question:  in a world of generically displayed drugstore greeting cards, how do you showcase the magic of a LovePop?</p>

                        <p>To kick off this project, Ryan and I met with the internal team at LovePop. This meeting helped us define the scope of the project. With post-its on deck and sharpies in hand, our brainstorming session with the LovePop team started with a design-thinking classic "Hopes, Fears, and Sacred Cows". Further meetings with their retail strategy team, customer happiness team, and the LovePop founders helped Ryan and I better understand the challenges and limitations of their problem.</p>

                        <h1 class="big_numeral">2</h1>
                        <p>It was time to see LovePop vendors in action. Observing and interviewing shoppers at a handful of LovePop stops ranging in size and varying in location answered a lot of questions &mdash; What makes the sale? Who is buying LovePops? What works and what doesn't work?</p>
                        <p>Our research didn't stop with LovePop vendors. Ryan and I wanted to look beyond greeting cards for potential inspiration.  A candy shop, german power tools, and sustainable displays for upcycled bags (among other things) were some of our best sources of inspiration as we moved into the next stage of development.</p>

                        <p>Guided by the findings of our research, Ryan and I went back to the drawing board to brainstorm potential solutions. We iterated through the good and the bad of our ideas until we eventually landed on something that fulfilled our user needs and product requirements. But before we went back to the LovePop team to present our solution, we needed to make sure it could work.  Developing a prototype to be tested in shop allowed us to get some real-world observations and tangible user feedback to justify our solutions with legitimate research and data.</p>

                    <p>Due to the proprietary nature of this work, I am unable to share explicit details of the work we did and the solutions we arrived at. 
Please feel free to contact me directly if you are interested in seeing our final solutions.</p>
                    <p>I was passionate about our final design solution. Working with Ryan on this project was one of my first experiences designing in the "real world". I'd be lying if I said I loved to shop for greeting cards, but this project taught me you don't have to be a Hallmark regular to design an innovative greeting card buying experience.The solution we landed at checked all the boxes off the LovePop teams requirements, but it also made me excited about the future of buying a LovePop. Admittedly, if you walk into Faneuil Hall today, you probably won't see our full design solution attracting shoppers from all over, but this project taught me to celebrate even the smallest of successes - the LovePop team has adapted bits and pieces of our solution and our research got them one step closer to producing an effective customer experience.</p>
