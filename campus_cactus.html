                        <p>Establishing Campus Cactus' presence, especially online, was importnat to getting the ball rolling.  We collected content for weeks.  A <a href="http://campuscactus.com">website</a> outlined the importnat details.  <a href="https://broken.instagram.com">instagram (NEED A LINK)</a> conected us to potential customers and a Facebook event gave students something to look forward to.

                    <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
                    <p>Due to the proprietary nature of this work, I am unable to share explicit details of the work we did and the solutions we arrived at. 
Please feel free to contact me directly if you are interested in seeing our final solutions.</p>
                    <p>I was passionate about our final design solution. Working with Ryan on this project was one of my first experiences designing in the "real world". I'd be lying if I said I loved to shop for greeting cards, but this project taught me you don't have to be a Hallmark regular to design an innovative greeting card buying experience.The solution we landed at checked all the boxes off the LovePop teams requirements, but it also made me excited about the future of buying a LovePop. Admittedly, if you walk into Faneuil Hall today, you probably won't see our full design solution attracting shoppers from all over, but this project taught me to celebrate even the smallest of successes - the LovePop team has adapted bits and pieces of our solution and our research got them one step closer to producing an effective customer experience.</p>
