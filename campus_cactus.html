                            <p >Campus Cactus began with a single question: how could I help incoming college students adjust to campus life?  Partenerd with Ryan and Kim Habbyshaw of Local Supply Co. We answered this question the best way we could.  With cacti.</p>

                            <p>Establishing Campus Cactus' presence, especially online, was important to getting the ball rolling.  We collected content for weeks.  A <a href="http://campuscactus.com">website</a> outlined the important details.  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecampuscactus/">Instagram</a> connected us to potential customers and a Facebook event gave students something to look forward to.

                            <p>It takes a village, as they say.  I partnered with Loyal Supply Co., a Somerville based design shop, to make Campus Cactus a reality.  Together we made supporting local businesses and building a sense of community a priority.  For example, our cacti were supplied by a Massachusetts based nursery.  And, of course, these events couldn't have gotten off the ground without the support of the Tufts community.</p>

                        <p>Our events cultivated creative thinking.  By establishing an encouraging social environment around the event, students built the confidence necessary to go from saying "I don't know which one to pick!" to having a whole backstory for their new spiky friend.  And let's face it &mdash; the googlie eyes were the perfect final touch to really bring the cacti to life.</p>

                            <p>When I discovered Loyal Supply CO., a design store well off campus, I thought I had stumbled upon a hidden gem of the Somerville community.  Now, students frequent the shop and  a few students even work there.  Campus Cactus helped develop a relationship between this independent Somerville business, the university, and Tufts students.</p>
