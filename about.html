		<p class="about_text">Hi! I'm Avery. <br> I recently graduated from Tufts University where I studied Engineering Psychology, Computer Science, and Studio Art. My mom describes this as "a little all over the place", but I believe the intersection of these three disciplines exists in creating simple and intentional solutions to complex problems through a human-centered approach. I strive to use user-centered research strategies and an iterative design approach to make experiences accessible, enjoyable, and sustainable. <br>

		<p class="about_text">When I'm not working you will probably find me getting lost in the intimate details of an art project. I strive to embrace a contemporary and experimental approach to traditional mediums (printmaking and embroidery are my personal favorites). I've also been known to play (and win) a game or two with my friends. Hearts is a personal favorite - a <a class="intext_link" href="http://wwmairs.com/what/games/hearts1/"> summer-long tournament</a>* between me and some friends logged 234 games and crowned one ultimate champion. <br>
		As a strong believer in the value of getting out of your comfort zone, I've packed my bags and I'm headed out West. Specifically, I've left the East Coast behind for Denver, Colorado, where I am currently seeking full-time employment. <a class="intext_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOB4VdlkzO4">Rocky Mountain High</a> here I come!</p>
