The only missing piece? A website to showcase this robust, innovative, and unrivaled program. </p>

                            <h2> The Problem </h2>
                            <p> The CU Real Estate Center lacked a substantive way to showcase everything that makes its Real Estate Technology program unique. The program needed a website to serve as its visual portfolio - showcasing Mike DelPrete's work, publicizing program events, and functioning as a resource for students. In order to represent the cutting edge nature of the Real Estate Technology program, this site needed to be design driven, presenting this information and these access points effectively and with visual intention.  </p>

                            <h2> The Strategy </h2>
                            <p> When they contacted us for help, the Real Estate Center needed a functional website yesterday. For this project, we utilized an agile approach to iterative design. Internal meetings with Mike DelPrete and the CU Boulder team kicked off the project, matched with external research on related web pages and programs. Following the initial research, we established the information architecture of the site, with organization and usability in mind. Throughout the process, visual mockups and wireframes were made available for the team to critique, leaving  space for feedback and design iteration to ensure we were on the right track as we made progress through the project. Once we arrived at a clean and innovative design that met both the team's expectations and the end users needs, we conducted thorough testing for browser compatibility, HTML syntax and CSS validation, and functional operation and accuracy.  </p>

								<div class="content center_vertical">
									<h2>The Solution</h2>
									<p>Iterations in color scheme, site maps and layout, and wireframes led us to our final design. The team requested a simple and clean design with bold colors and a to-the-point layout. Completed within a 2 week deadline, this single-page final design satisfied our client's needs and left plenty of room for further development, if ever needed. </p>
